# Summary
The Columbia River water management system is an example of an institutionally-complex human–environmental system that is used to balance the conflicting demands of its food–energy–water (FEW) stakeholders. The system includes more than 30 major storage and run-of-the-river dams that are operated to control floods, produce hydroelectricity, meet irrigation demands, and support environmental flow targets. While FEW stakeholders in the system are already experiencing significant stressors (e.g., droughts, floods, ecosystem impacts), the system is projected to be more vulnerable due to changes in climate while facing potential evolving water management policies (e.g., the transboundary U.S.–Canada Columbia River Treaty). The research community has extensively studied the future of the system using the original version of ColSim (written in Stella); however, to date, the absence of an open-source river-system modeling tool that can efficiently simulate system dynamics for a large ensemble of climate and/or management scenarios has been a limiting technical challenge. In this study, we present RColSim, a script-based river-system model of the Columbia River written in the R programming language. The model considers rule curves and regional constraints to simulate the operation of 33 dams on the Columbia River and also takes system-wide environmental and hydroelectricity targets into account.
