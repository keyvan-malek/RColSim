	abstract = {Changes in air temperature and precipitation can modify snowmelt-driven runoff in snowmelt-dominated regimes. This study focuses on climate change impacts on the snow hydrology of the Fraser River basin ({FRB}) of British Columbia ({BC}), Canada, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model ({VIC}). Statistically downscaled forcing datasets based on 12 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}5) are used to drive {VIC} for two 30-yr time periods, a historical baseline (1980–2009) and future projections (2040–69: 2050s), under representative concentration pathways ({RCPs}) 4.5 and 8.5. The ensemble-based {VIC} simulations reveal widespread and regionally coherent spatial changes in snowfall, snow water equivalent ({SWE}), and snow cover over the {FRB} by the 2050s. While the mean precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease by nearly 50\% in the 2050s compared to the baseline. Snow accumulation and snow-covered area are projected to decline substantially across the {FRB}, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. Onset of springtime snowmelt in the 2050s is projected to be nearly 25 days earlier than historically, yielding more runoff in the winter and spring for the Fraser River at Hope, {BC}, and earlier recession to low-flow volumes in summer. The ratio of snowmelt contribution to runoff decreases by nearly 20\% in the Stuart and Nautley subbasins of the {FRB} in the 2050s. The decrease in {SWE} and loss of snow cover is greater from low to midelevations than in high elevations, where temperatures remain sufficiently cold for precipitation to fall as snow.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  As part of the National Assessment of Climate Change, the implications of future climate predictions derived from four global climate models ({GCMs}) were used to evaluate possible future changes to Pacific Northwest climate, the surface water response of the Columbia River basin, and the ability of the Columbia River reservoir system to meet regional water resources objectives. Two representative {GCM} simulations from the Hadley Centre ({HC}) and Max Planck Institute ({MPI}) were selected from a group of {GCM} simulations made available via the National Assessment for climate change. From these simulations, quasi-stationary, decadal mean temperature and precipitation changes were used to perturb historical records of precipitation and temperature data to create inferred conditions for 2025, 2045, and 2095. These perturbed records, which represent future climate in the experiments, were used to drive a macro-scale hydrology model of the Columbia River at 1/8 degree resolution. The altered streamflows simulated for each scenario were, in turn, used to drive a reservoir model, from which the ability of the system to meet water resources objectives was determined relative to a simulated hydrologic base case (current climate). Although the two {GCM} simulations showed somewhat different seasonal patterns for temperature change, in general the simulations show reasonably consistent basin average increases in temperature of about 1.8–2.1°C for 2025, and about 2.3–2.9°C for 2045. The {HC} simulations predict an annual average temperature increase of about 4.5°C for 2095. Changes in basin averaged winter precipitation range from -1 percent to + 20 percent for the {HC} and {MPI} scenarios, and summer precipitation is also variously affected. These changes in climate result in significant increases in winter runoff volumes due to increased winter precipitation and warmer winter temperatures, with resulting reductions in snowpack. Average March 1 basin average snow water equivalents are 75 to 85 percent of the base case for 2025, and 55 to 65 percent of the base case by 2045. By 2045 the reduced snowpack and earlier snow melt, coupled with higher evapotranspiration in early summer, would lead to earlier spring peak flows and reduced runoff volumes from April-September ranging from about 75 percent to 90 percent of the base case. Annual runoff volumes range from 85 percent to 110 percent of the base case in the simulations for 2045. These changes in streamflow create increased competition for water during the spring, summer, and early fall between non-firm energy production, irrigation, instream flow, and recreation. Flood control effectiveness is moderately reduced for most of the scenarios examined, and desirable navigation conditions on the Snake are generally enhanced or unchanged. Current levels of winter-dominated firm energy production are only significantly impacted for the {MPI} 2045 simulations.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of {NSE} (and hence {MSE}), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the {NSE} (or {MSE}) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the {MSE}. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

Social–ecological interactions among stakeholders often complicate natural-resource conservation and management of riverscapes. The management challenges posed by the conservation and restoration of wild salmonid populations in the Columbia River Basin ({CRB}) of western North America are one such example. Because of their ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic importance, salmonids present a complex management landscape due to interacting environmental factors (eg climate change, invasive species) as well as socioeconomic and political factors (eg dams, hatcheries, land-use change, transboundary agreements). Many of the problems in the {CRB} can be linked to social–ecological interactions occurring within integrated ecological, human–social, and regional–climatic spheres. Future management and conservation of salmonid populations therefore depends on how well the issues are understood and whether they can be resolved through effective communication and collaboration among ecologists, social scientists, stakeholders, and policy makers.},

Mean annual prespawn mortality estimates across 14 years ranged from 0 \% to 65 \%. For spring-run Chinook salmon, the probability of prespawn mortality decreased over the spawning period, was positively associated with mean August stream temperature and individual fish length, and was higher for hatchery-origin than natural-origin fish. Based on the basin-wide statistical model and future stream temperature predictions, average spring-run Chinook salmon prespawn mortality rates in 2040 were predicted to increase by 0–17 \% for fish of natural origin and 1–17 \% for fish of hatchery origin. Climate change is likely to exacerbate conditions that lead to prespawn mortality, particularly in low elevation stream reaches, for larger fish, and for those of hatchery origin.},

While scientific knowledge on climate change abounds, literature syntheses are needed to understand the multidisciplinary impacts, identify critical knowledge gaps, and assess potential management and policy responses. In this study, we systematically map and analyze the topical and spatial distribution of climate change research in the mountainous headwaters of a major transboundary watershed, the Columbia River Basin ({CRB}). We find that climate change research in the {CRB} focuses on impacts much more frequently than adaptation, while mitigation is rarely a focus. Most studies assess trends at large spatial extents, use secondary data, and make projections of climate change impacts rather than observations. The spatial distribution and thematic content of research vary across an international border, with greater concentrations of research in the {USA} than Canada. A general scarcity of social science research and limited interaction between social and biophysical content reinforce the need for increased collaboration between disparate disciplines. Future research focus areas should include research related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, increased integration between social and biophysical sciences, and collaborations that bridge the international border for a more unified basin-wide focus. Focusing on these new directions for research will increase the potential for science and management communities to co-produce actionable science and effective responses to climate change.},

This new approach to governance is of particular importance on rivers within or shared by countries in which water management is fragmented among national and sub-national levels of government as well as among governmental sectors. This article focuses on the Columbia River Basin, in the United States and Canada. Review of the Columbia River Treaty governing shared management of the river has opened a public dialogue on river governance. Treaty review coincides with change in both the biophysical setting and the values and capacity of basin residents. Climate change is altering the timing of flow relied on by the management of developed river infrastructure and the annual runs of the basins’ salmonid species. River development increased economic development in the basin, but at the cost of ecosystem function. Assertion of legal rights by indigenous communities has brought an alternative world view to the review—one that seeks to maintain the benefits of river development while reconciling that development with ecosystem function. This article identifies the governance mechanisms needed to achieve reconciliation and describes their emergence in the Columbia River Basin through an analytical framework focused on local capacity building and network formation across jurisdictions, sectors, and scales of governance. Both countries fragment water management authority among jurisdictions and sectors, but bridging organizations have emerged to link interests and government at the watershed and basin scale. Emergence of new governance is facilitated by increases in local, regional, and indigenous governance capacity. This networked governance emerging at the biophysical scale while embedded in and linked to a hierarchy of formal international, national, state, and local government is characterized as the ecology of governance.},

The multi-model ensemble 30-year mean annual temperature increases by 2.8 °C (5.0 °C) by late 21st century under {RCP}4.5 ({RCP}8.5) over the 1979–1990 baseline, with 18\% (24\%) more warming in summer. By late 21st century, annual precipitation increases by 5\% (8\%), with an 8\% (14\%) winter increase and a 4\% (10\%) summer decrease, but because some models project changes of opposite sign, confidence in these sign changes is lower than those for temperature. Four questions about temperature and precipitation changes were addressed: (1) How and why do climate projections vary seasonally? (2) Is interannual variability in seasonal temperature and precipitation projected to change? (3) What explains the large inter-model spread in the projections? (4) Do projected changes in climate depend on model skill? Changes in precipitation and temperature vary seasonally as a result of changes in large-scale circulation and regional surface energy budget, respectively. Interannual temperature variability decreases slightly during the cool seasons and increases in summer, while interannual precipitation variability increases in all seasons. The magnitude of regional warming is linked to models’ global climate sensitivity, whereas internal variability dominates the inter-model spread of precipitation changes. Lastly, {GCMs} that better reproduce historical climate tend to project greater warming and larger precipitation increases, though these results depend on the evaluation method.},

By examining the unusual case of salmon tallying and research in this region, this article argues that while population biology has been repeatedly used within problematic and even violent state projects, in certain contexts it can also become a practice of multispecies noticing and a catalyst for new coalitions. Based on this example, the article raises broad questions about what renewed attention to population biology might contribute to the growing subfield of more-than-human anthropology. It argues that anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the possibilities for numbers and population concepts to positively contribute to movements for more livable worlds.

	abstract = {Around the world, long-term changes in the timing and magnitude of streamflow are testing the ability of large managed water resource systems constructed in the 20th century to continue to meet objectives in the 21st century. Streamflow records for unregulated rivers upstream of reservoirs can be combined with records downstream of reservoirs using a paired-watershed framework and concepts of water resource system performance to assess how reservoir management has responded to long-term change. Using publicly available data, this study quantified how the intra-annual timing of inflows and outflows of 25 major reservoirs has shifted, how management has responded, and how this has influenced reliability and vulnerability of the water resource system in the 668,000 km2 Columbia River basin from 1950 to 2012. Reservoir inflows increased slightly in early spring and declined in late spring to early fall, but reservoir outflows increased in late summer from 1950 to 2012. Average inflows to reservoirs in the low flow period exceeded outflows in the1950s, but inflows are now less than outflows. Reservoirs have increased hedging, that is, they have stored more water during the spring, in order to meet the widening gap between inflows and outflows during the summer low flow period. For a given level of reliability (the fraction of time flow targets were met), vulnerability (the maximum departure from the flow target) was greater during periods with lower than average inflows. Thus, the water management system in this large river basin has adjusted to multi-decade trends of declining inflows, but vulnerability, that is, the potential for excess releases in spring and shortfalls in summer, has increased. This study demonstrates the value of combining publicly available historical data on streamflow with concepts from paired-watershed analyses and metrics of water resource performance to detect, evaluate, and manage water resource systems in large river basins.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: The Pacific Northwest ({PNW}) regional assessment is an integrated examination of the consequences of natural climate variability and projected future climate change for the natural and human systems of the region. The assessment currently focuses on four sectors: hydrology/water resources, forests and forestry, aquatic ecosystems, and coastal activities. The assessment begins by identifying and elucidating the natural patterns of climate vanability in the {PNW} on interannual to decadal timescales. The pathways through which these climate variations are manifested and the resultant impacts on the natural and human systems of the region are investigated. Knowledge of these pathways allows an analysis of the potential impacts of future climate change, as defined by {IPCC} climate change scenarios. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of hydrology and water resources to climate variability and change. We focus on the Columbia River Basin, which covers approximately 75 percent of the {PNW} and is the basis for the dominant water resources system of the {PNW}. The water resources system of the Columbia River is sensitive to climate variability, especially with respect to drought. Management inertia and the lack of a centralized authority coordinating all uses of the resource impede adaptability to drought and optimization of water distribution. Climate change projections suggest exacerbated conditions of conflict between users as a result of low summertime streamfiow conditions. An understanding of the patterns and consequences of regional climate variability is crucial to developing an adequate response to future changes in climate.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in long-lead climate forecasting have made it possible to produce useful streamflow forecasts for the Columbia River basin roughly six months earlier than current forecasts that rely on snowpack measurements. The resulting increase in forecast lead time facilitates considerable improvements in system operating performance, especially in years of expected above average flows. In the current reservoir operating system, the so called “critical” and “assured refill” rule curves that restrict releases for hydropower generation in the period from August to December are based on the critical (most severe low flow) and third lowest flow sequences of record, respectively. These rule curves provide appropriate protection of energy capacity and reservoir refill in extreme low flow conditions, but are restrictive in normal and high flow years until midwinter when operational streamflow forecasts based on observed snowpack become available, and the climatological constraints are relaxed to account for expected summer streamflows. The use of long lead time streamflow forecasts allows current operating constraints to be relaxed in years when there is a high likelihood of ample streamflow. In these years, more spot market energy sales can be made in the late summer and fall/early winter because of increased available water for releases, and spill from reservoirs in wet years is also reduced. Reservoir model simulations using alternative reservoir rule curves based upon retrospective long-lead streamflow forecasts from water years 1931 to 1987 show that the proposed alternative operating system based on climate forecasts can increase nonfirm energy production from the major Columbia River hydropower dams by as much as 5.5 million {MW}/h/year, resulting in an average increase in annual revenue of approximately \$153 million per year in comparison with the status quo. Other uses of the Columbia River are largely unaffected by the proposed changes in the operating system. In particular, firm energy, the reliability of storage reservoir refill, and the frequency of meeting of streamflow targets for salmon protection would be essentially unchanged in comparison with the status quo. The increased hydropower revenue is therefore directly attributed to use of long-lead forecast information and does not represent a trade-off among other management objectives.},

	abstract = {Climate strongly affects energy supply and demand in the Pacific Northwest ({PNW}) and Washington State ({WA}). We evaluate potential effects of climate change on the seasonality and annual amount of {PNW} hydropower production, and on heating and cooling energy demand. Changes in hydropower production are estimated by linking simulated streamflow scenarios produced by a hydrology model to a simulation model of the Columbia River hydro system. Changes in energy demand are assessed using gridded estimates of heating degree days ({HDD}) and cooling degree days ({CDD}) which are then combined with population projections to create energy demand indices that respond both to climate, future population, and changes in residential air conditioning market penetration. We find that substantial changes in the amount and seasonality of energy supply and demand in the {PNW} are likely to occur over the next century in response to warming, precipitation changes, and population growth. By the 2040s hydropower production is projected to increase by 4.7–5.0\% in winter, decrease by about 12.1–15.4\% in summer, with annual reductions of 2.0–3.4\%. Larger decreases of 17.1–20.8\% in summer hydropower production are projected for the 2080s. Although the combined effects of population growth and warming are projected to increase heating energy demand overall (22–23\% for the 2020s, 35–42\% for the 2040s, and 56–74\% for the 2080s), warming results in reduced per capita heating demand. Residential cooling energy demand (currently less than one percent of residential demand) increases rapidly (both overall and per capita) to 4.8–9.1\% of the total demand by the 2080s due to increasing population, cooling degree days, and air conditioning penetration.},

In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2°C2°C{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}2{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}°{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}C{\textless}/mtext{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} increase in air temperature.

	abstract = {Adaptation to a changing climate is critical to address future global food and water security challenges. While these challenges are global, successful adaptation strategies are often generated at regional scales; therefore, regional-scale studies are critical to inform adaptation decision making. While climate change affects both water supply and demand, water demand is relatively understudied, especially at regional scales. The goal of this work is to address this gap, and characterize the direct impacts of near-term (for the 2030s) climate change and elevated {CO}2 levels on regional-scale crop yields and irrigation demands for the Columbia River basin ({CRB}). This question is addressed through a coupled crop-hydrology model that accounts for site-specific and crop-specific characteristics that control regional-scale response to climate change. The overall near-term outlook for agricultural production in the {CRB} is largely positive, with yield increases for most crops and small overall increases in irrigation demand. However, there are crop-specific and location-specific negative impacts as well, and the aggregate regional response of irrigation demands to climate change is highly sensitive to the spatial crop mix. Low-value pasture/hay varieties of crops—typically not considered in climate change assessments—play a significant role in determining the regional response of irrigation demands to climate change, and thus cannot be overlooked. While, the overall near-term outlook for agriculture in the region is largely positive, there may be potential for a negative outlook further into the future, and it is important to consider this in long-term planning.},

It explores approaches and tools supporting the design of strategic plans under deep uncertainty, and their testing in the real world, including barriers and enablers for their use in practice. The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part {II}, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part {III} focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part {IV} contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work. The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the {RAND} Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares. ; Offers a comprehensive examination of the approaches and tools for designing plans under deep uncertainty and their application Identifies barriers and enablers for the use of the various approaches and tools in practice Includes realistic examples and practical guidelines to help readers better understand the concepts},

However, uncertainty in various forms challenges inferences from modeling results. Model-based support for decision-making has increasingly adopted an emerging exploratory approach. This approach addresses uncertainty explicitly through systematically exploring the implications of modeling assumptions, aiming to enhance the robustness of inferences from models. Despite a variety of applications, the extent and the way(s) that exploratory modeling can deal with the challenges that arise from the uncertainty and complexity of decision-making with stakeholders has not yet been systematically framed. We address this gap in two ways. First, we present a taxonomy of the ways that exploratory modeling can be used to inform robust inferences in coupled human-natural systems by mapping the technical capabilities of this approach in relation to the diversity of past applications. This subsequently guides an investigation of the practical benefits and challenges of these capabilities in handling uncertainty and complexity. Second, we discuss different ways for integrating genuine stakeholder engagement into exploratory modeling through transdisciplinary research. Finally we outline some priorities for future expansion of this research area.},

	abstract = {Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge in water resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate for “scenario-neutral” analyses in which alternative policies are evaluated over plausible future scenarios with no assessment of their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks use sensitivity analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design monitoring programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes in the critical uncertainties. However, scenario-neutral analyses make implicit assumptions about the range and independence of the uncertain factors that may not be consistent with the coupled human-hydrologic processes influencing the system. These assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most important and which policies are most robust, belying their neutrality; assuming uniformity and independence could have decision-relevant implications. This study illustrates these implications using a multistakeholder planning problem within the Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for the river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation. Variance-based sensitivity analyses are performed to assess users' vulnerabilities to changing hydrologic conditions using four experimental designs: (1) scenario-neutral samples of hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical conditions, (2) scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios informed by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario-neutral samples of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental designs. Differences in sensitivities and user robustness rankings across the experiments illustrate the challenges of inferring the most consequential drivers of vulnerabilities to design effective monitoring programs and robust management policies.},
